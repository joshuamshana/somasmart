# P0 Journeys

## Journey 1 — Student learns offline
Given a student registers, when they browse lessons, then they can open an approved lesson offline, complete a quiz, and see tutor feedback.

## Journey 2 — Teacher upload + admin approval
Given a teacher registers, when an admin approves them, then the teacher can upload a lesson and submit it for review.

## Journey 3 — Admin lesson review loop
Given a pending lesson exists, when an admin approves or rejects it with feedback, then the teacher sees the feedback and approved lessons appear in the student catalog.

## Journey 4 — Coupon unlock
Given locked content exists, when a student redeems a coupon/voucher offline, then a license grant is created and access is unlocked.
